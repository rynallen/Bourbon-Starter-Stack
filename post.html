            <p>At the start of a product idea the designer uses wireframes, mockups and prototypes to get feedback as fast as possible. Balancing the amount of time spent creating these temporary assets and reducing misinterpretation is key.</p><p>Tools like Illustrator give the designer the flexibility to experiment and draw without being forced to think about technical constraints early in the process. It's great for quickly outputting static mockups, though Illustrator does not have great tools built-in to express interactions or different states in the product</p><p>You now created all three necessary files:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>An Illustrator file in which you can edit the visual part of the prototype.</li>
                <li>An exported SVG file that will be loaded by the browser (do not edit).</li>
                <li>An HTML file that contains the JavaScript.</li>

            <p>As a product designer at Chartbeat, the <a href="">biggest</a> challenge I face is how to incorporate huge amounts of data into as simple an interface as possible; not only do we have to pick which metrics fit the story we’re trying to tell, but also when we should show them. In this post, I break down a few behind-the-scenes design decisions that went into Chartbeat’s dashboard. This part of the design has a big impact, but is often not mentioned when we talk about the end result.</p><h2 class="article__title2">Setting up the playground</h2>
            <p>We're almost at the fun part. Because the HTML embeds the SVG; both files need to be loaded from the same webserver. This is because of browser security restrictions. If you're already editing on a webserver you don't have to do anything. If you are working on your local computer you can use your favorite webserver or open your terminal and go to (type "cd" and drag the folder onto the terminal) the directory the files are in and run:</p>
